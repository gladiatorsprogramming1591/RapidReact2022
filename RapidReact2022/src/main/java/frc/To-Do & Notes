Notes to self: figure out how to simulate motors

-TURN ON/OFF LEDS
ADD SOMETHING TO ENSURE THE RIGHT ANGLE FOR CLIMB PREP
-SHOOT ONE OPTION 0 --In Progress
-FULL CHUCK OPTION
-"NUDGE" OPTION FOR INTAKE
-ORGANIZE SHUFFLEBOARD

BUTTON MAPPING:
  MANIPULATOR STICK:

(Need to figure out mapping for "regergitate all" to fit along with climb buttons)

RESEARCH:
-How to get world angle (north,south,etc.)



NOTES:: -When ball is at the top of the hopper between the "stopper" and hopper belts,
hopper does not advance (too little power?). (REMAINS AN ISSUE)
-Justin brought up that belts of intake seem to skip when  when manually turned ontop of ball,
have not tested if the same ran by the motor.

PENDING TEST:
-REGURGITATE ONE --if failed, test what encoder position  is ONE BALL LENGTH








POSSIBLY REDUNDANT:
-Look into DeepSpace's camera server group to reference for including Microsoft Camera
-Look into Thunderclap's drive ecoder; possible copy and paste

COMPLETED:
3/3/22
-UP ON D-PAD --ADVANCE HOPPER
-DOWN D-PAD REVERSE HOPPER (JUST HOPPER)
-ALL CLIMB POSTITIONS TO TESTSTICK
-kA: ENABLE SLOW     kA:ENABLE FAST
-FIX TURNIG LEFT TOO FAST (SENSITIVE)*** --Bad Joystick

3/4/22
-Program new motor controllers (CAN ID 10 AND 5)
-Intake motor controller current limit: set to 50 --set all to 50
-Programmed 2nd intake motor
-Found 25ft Ethernet Cable
-FIX SLOW MODE (and simplified) --Used .toggleWhenPressed

3/5/22
-PROGRAM SERVOS CONTROLLING CLIMB HOOKS: PWM 9 LEFT, PWM 8 RIGHT
-MINIMUM SPEED SHOOTER OPTION

3/6/22
  MANIPULATOR STICK:
    SHOOTER
      (for sure)
      -R1- HIGH GOAL SPEED
      -R2- LOW GOAL SPEED
      (may change)
      -L1- BLEH SPEED
      -L2- STOP SHOOTER
-ADD SHOOTING MODES TO S.B. --strings

3/7/22
-"-REGERGITATE ALL OPTION -- LEFT POV (POSSIBLY TESTSTICK)" May not be needed
